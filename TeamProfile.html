                  <p class="p1">My team’s name will be “E.T” since the appearance of the virtual assistant looks like an alien in general. Therefore, I would like to name my team the same as the project’s name. Currently, my team has three members, they are Pham Viet Hoang, Pham Viet Hao, and me.</p>
                  <p class="p2">According to the tests that I have done in the previous assignment, I am an introverted person, and shy to speak out my opinions in order to contribute to the project. Therefore, I would like my teammates to be open with me, so we can understand each other and work more collaboratively. If the team feels comfortable while working together, I believed the result tends to be more successful, since there is no stress or pressure. </p>
