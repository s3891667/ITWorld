                  <p class="ITTech">This project is about a virtual assistant, which can perfectly interact with a human, as well as support them. Therefore, we will need some advanced techniques to develop the application. Specifically, our team will choose two areas, those are Artificial intelligence and machine learning, and Natural Language processing, and chatterbots.  </p>
                  <li class="ITTech"> Artificial intelligence and machine learning </li>
                  <p class="ITTech"> The unique detail about the technology is that it is more proactive and responsive than any other AI on the market. The purpose of this project is to reach as similar human performance as we can; Therefore, there are a lot of things that we need to work on. Currently, we are basing on the most identical AI, Siri to research for more features and techniques. Along with that, since the E.T project contains a lot of special traits that are able to solve many real problems, thus we also consider calling out for investments from many places to make this project happened. I believe for the next year, we will finish all the algorithms as well as data input for the application. After three years, we hope that our virtual assistant would be able to reach the performance that we have proposed before. About the technical part, E.T will be programmed to be the smart assistant and able to have human intelligence, companions to serve humans so this is the crucial part that consumes the most time of the project. In general, firstly we will import diverse and thousands of data into the AI, such as information relating to health, human, and other technologies. Secondly, those data need to be cleaned and split into two parts, training, and test sets. Later, we will develop the algorithms, which help E.T the intelligence like recognize diverse of information from the environment and user for it the solve problems smartly or receiving input and send out the output technically. This is the important part of the technology; However, we do not have to create new algorithms from scratches by ourselves, since some libraries can support us, such as NumPy and Pandas. The next step, that is we need to train our model to solve problems in ways that are appropriate for its purpose. Finally, we need to evaluate all the features that have been developed in order to find bugs after testing as well as plans for features improvements in the future. Since we can our design to become flexible and smart so it can execute users’ demands in advance. Throughout the development because coding in a traditional is more complicated for AI. Therefore, we use utilize python as the main language in coding. E.T is built as same as others Artificial intelligence model, that is making human lives more convenient and comfortable. Instead of a billion dollars humanoid robot Sophia, our model will be an application for everyone. Since we do not focus on the outlook of E.T, instead, we aim to reach the highest efficiency that an AI could perform. </P>
                  <p class="ITTech">When this project is completed, it must be a huge impact on the human daily basis. As I mentioned above, with the AI technique and Machine learning, E.T can support humans with human intelligence. Using E.T is identical to have your own assistant who is always ready when you need helps. The application potentially changes the ways that humans used to react with an AI because regularly an AI will receive an input of our languages as input first then solve to give us the output. The new technology can help E.T react to that action will be much faster. Not only does it generate speed, but it also can predict the next actions or words from the users to support like a normal person. As its helpfulness and intelligence, the project’s potential users can be students, the elderly, and patients. Collecting and analyzing data to give information is very essential for students because they can find and learn new things while using E.T to support their studying. E.T can compare and select the most reliable sources; Therefore, students can have diverse visions as well as be provided knowledge. For the elderly and patients, the application can detect dangerous situations by hard dropping or screaming voices, having E.T as a companion potentially save their lives by calling SOS, if they are alone. E.T can assist humans and make their lives more convenient  </p>
                  <p class="ITTech"> For me, I am the kind of person who usually forgets important things and often thinks negatively. I believe using E.T can help me feel better when I am stressed as well as reminding to do take medicines or go to an appointment. Furthermore, with the application, all my activities might be more well prepared since I can ask E.T to organize the timetable for me. Plus, finding the address usually confuses me most of the time, but the application is programmed to support it, therefore it can display pictures, more information in detail and I think with full information, I can do that easily. Everyone around me will be interested in using this application because it is great to have a helpful assistant by your side. However, some people may find it difficult to use, for example, some people are used to looking at the things that are displayed in front of their screens and they do not know what to ask about. Thus, the project might work on the tutorials for specific types of ages as well as knowledge. In conclusion, having an application using AI and machine learning, will help human lives more safe, comfortable, and convenient than they used to be. The development of this technique can potentially replace some management business if it well developed in the future and able to generate high the productivity. However, with the multi-functionality of the application in order to make it effective, the development team must need to work on more areas to fulfill businesses’ demands, such as, NLP, Cybersecurity and privacy, and Cloud computing (services, platforms, servers etc.).  </p>
                  <li class="ITTech">Natural Language processing </li>
                  <p class ="ITTech">  Currently, with the combination of Machine learning and NLP, humans can create many useful chat bot and AI that can support human for some specific purposes. Yet, E.T will be the revolutionary innovation, which can support many aspects in daily life. To help E.T become more efficient and operate properly, Natural language processing will contribute to the results. The AI parts will need data from NLP to complete its tasks in supporting the users. In the developing process, we will utilize the text-to-speech engine and speech recognition to create a human voice for E.T as well as to give the ability to understand what the users say. However, different from Apple’s Siri, E.T is more than just answering questions since it can communicate or giving advice proactively based on the data collected from real conversations. Therefore, this potentially took about 3 years of development, since it is the unique features that make this application distinct from other technologies. Apart from that, we also manipulate Natural language processing, one of the branches in Artificial Intelligence, this technique combines with algorithms allows E.T to have the ability to understand human languages. The first step to initialize this technology is tokenization, which means we need to match specific words with numbers(tokens) and then match them in the correct position in order to create a complete sentence in a correct sequence. Therefore, we need to input a lot of information for E.T to speak with humans fluently. Secondly, it is sequencing, we will turn sentences into data because if we create all the sequences manually, that will consume years of work. The development team uses this technique so that unrecognized words will be created a token for it automatically, so the input languages for E.T can be simpler. Plus, padding technique is necessary, since we want that E.T the communication between E.T and customers to be limited by the number of words in a sentence. Therefore, we apply it to the system to organize the words properly. Finally, we combine machine learning with the recurrent neural networks for E.T to predict the next word in the sentence. Specifically, from the data and the labels, we create the model to have a rule for E.T, since it can predict the next word by the previous word (RNN). For example, in a sentence like “happy birth …”, E.T can automatically recognize the last word as “day”.  </p>
                  <p class="ITTech"> In the future, with the support of this technology, E.T can easily detect human voices in order to support users’ demands effectively. Depending on the customers’ needs, we might develop a business another version of this application. This version can replace some positions in the company for example secretary since E.T can operate perfectly while interacting with a human. Plus, it can solve and evaluate documents for the company as well as organize appointments for the collectives. Furthermore, E.T will help the organization to calculate employee’s salaries based on the data input every day by workers, such as the number of days off, and how long they work per day. Yet, we will have to consider developing Cybersecurity and privacy because in business, leaking internal information is a severe issue that many companies want to avoid. Significantly, this technology will help service businesses to reduce number of employees, since the application can interact with the customers effective if it has a data of the company. However, the high performance and smart application potentially leads to the unemployment. Instead, many businesses will replace the service forces by ITs and engineers who can operate or do some implement for an AI and to avoid from being hack.</p>
                  <p class="ITTech"> I, myself, if I had a virtual assistant, which could understand what I said, there will be no difficulties in communicating. Not only E.T can understand, but it also can predict what you are trying to say, therefore the process that the application reacts will be faster than it used to be. For example, Siri must receive information from our voice first, then execute the commands. Yet, with the new technology we develop for the E.T, we can have a real-time conversation with the application. In addition, elderly people can feel easier to use with the smart interactions from an A.I.</p>
