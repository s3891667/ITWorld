                  <h1 class="FB">III. Feedback</h1>
                  <h2 class="FB">Pham Viet Hoang:   </h2>
                  <p class="FB">  Creating an app to make it looks like a real friend to support the user in most problems of daily life. That is the reason why I think your project is distinctive and different from Siri of Apple or another virtual assistant. On the other hand, your app focuses on helping the disabled and patients, issue a warning if necessary, and considering UI/ UX design well. However, you said that your project associate with a popular application such as Google, Safari. I think you should consider it seriously, as you must share your market with the big shark of technology empire. Your project is useful for everything, yet you must know that everything would be confusing if your team must accomplish many and many complicated steps to run it.  </p>
                  <h3 class="FB"> Pham Viet Hao:  </h3>
                  <p class="FB">  What a great idea you are having. Even though there are many virtual assistances, they do not have as many functions as yours. Being ambitious is great, but you should consider how you can carry out the plan, and it might take a lot of time until you can make it come true. Plus, the most advanced AI in the world Sophie is not published on mobile devices yet, and its company will plan for that in the future .But, overall, I think it is a good project, nothing is impossible, and I believe someday you can change the world with this idea. </p>
                  <h4 class="FB">  My comments about the feedbacks: </h4>
                  <p class="FB">After reading all the feedback from my teammates, I agree with their feedback, and they have helped me investigate the project from many different aspects. To make this project complete is not easy. ET is an AI that can solve so many problems for humans, therefore we have to work on many areas, such as Cybersecurity and privacy, Cloud computing. Furthermore, I am raising funds for the initialization as well as share my market, since many big tech companies are currently developing this technology. In addition, if we want this AI to react as fast as humans, we have to continue to research more in order to develop the AI technique because the most advance AI in the world Sophie, she remains some delay while interacting with people. Plus, publishing an AI on mobile devices will require the time and effort of the whole development team. Overall, I see that their reviews are helpful for my project ideas, and I can acknowledge the current issues of my project. From that, I can solve those easier and be more successful in developing processes.  </p>
