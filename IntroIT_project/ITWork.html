                  <h1 class="IW" >V. IT Work</h1>
                  <p class="IW">  Last week I had the opportunity to have Mr. Hung Lam in my interview about his 22 years IT professional career in The United States at Cell Force. During his job at his company, he with his colleagues are working on developing customer relationship management. Specifically, helping the customer to manage sales and customer support. Along with that, an II professional also has to work with the clients to support them solve problems. He will have to work with the customer services team collaboratively, therefore he can know exactly what the defects are. Plus, there are activities that sometimes they have to do is testing their codes to see if it works well or not. Since the company has a whole test team, so he rarely has to do that. While working there are some other IT professionals </p>
                  <p class='IW'>For example, Architect to help him design, or review the feature, and the testers who will help him test the products. Plus, sometimes he works with the salesperson in the company to receive questions from the customers. Cell Force has many types of clients, includes many big brands, such as Dunkin Donuts, Carvel, and many other big brands. He usually spends most of his time figuring out the new features and make an implement for the products to make the products increase the usability. </p>
                  <p class="IW">According to Mr. Hung, where he spends most of his time doing the job is not important, since being a software engineer will have a flexible work time. Especially he can work anywhere he wants as long as the job is done by the proposed timeline. The most challenging part of working at his job is that you cannot satisfy all your customers, furthermore, it is hard to investigate the users’ demands. </p>
                  <p class="IW"> Not only does he find it hard to identify all the demands, but He also struggling with persuading the customers to use the product in the way that the design team has intended. Finally, the best aspects of being a software engineer as he told me are high demands and many new things. Specifically, this industry in the future will need a lot of workers who can do coding, which leads to the average income for a job is high. Moreover, every day there are a lot of new things are happening in this industry, even those who have been working as an IT professional for 22 years like him cannot know everything. That is also the reason, which stimulates him to work in the industry for that long.   </p>
