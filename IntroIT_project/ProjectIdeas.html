                  <h1 class="ProjectIdeas">II. Project Ideas</h1>
                  <h2 class="ProjectIdeas">  1.Overview:</h2>
                  <p class="PI">The project is called E.T, which is the virtual assistant application on mobile devices, which will help the users to manage almost everything on a daily basis, such as studying, gaming, traveling, and meals. When opening the application, users will have to inform their basic information and things that they want to assist. Thereafter, E.T will float on the screen to interact with the users to help them. The reason for the initial of this project that is I was inspired by the movie E.T and Siri from iPhone; However, it is more developed. My ambition is to utilize AI technology to create virtual friends on mobile phones that can help humans increase their lives quality.       </p>
                  <img class="AIpic" src="AI.jpg">
                  <h3 class="ProjectIdeas">  2.Motivation:</h3>
                  <p class="PI">  E.T can communicate with the users, like iPhone Siri but more advanced. Since communicating with E.T is identical to talking with a real assistant. Furthermore, the users can modify the appearances of E.T by their interests. E.T will be connected and associate with many useful apps, such as google Maps, safari, and google. The users only need to open the app and directly talk with their virtual assistant. E.T in general is a tool for collecting data and analyzing to give useful information to the users. Customers can minimize their actions to execute their goals, for example searching for the coffee shop nearby.  </p>
                  <h4 class="ProjectIdeas">  3.Descriptions:</h4>
                  <p class="PI">Virtual assistant E.T is a multifunctional application; it helps the users to simplify their living routines and furthermore. Not only does E. T communicates with the users as a friend, but it is also the best solution for researching. If the user wants information, E.T will tell them the information, as well as display links, images. E.T project contains three main features, those are house, information, and life, and disabled assistant. </p>
                  <h5 class="ProjectIdeas"> -House assistant:</h5>
                  <p class="PI">  E.T can connect to the house, apartment electric systems to do some basic actions like turn on and off the lights without receiving commands from the users. Furthermore, customers can adjust the settings for E.T behavior in order to match their expectations, for example, do not open the light after 10 P.M. Virtual will collect information from the users throughout time, from that E.T will increase the supporting performance.  </p>
                  <img class="homepic" src="home.jpg">
                  <h6 class="ProjectIdeas"> -Information and life assistant:</h6>
                  <p class="PI">  This virtual assistant works well in research for information. It can directly display images, links for the users. Moreover, E.T will ask “if they need to see in detail?”, once the owners agree it directs to another application, such as google maps, and Instagram instantly. This feature of E.T is useful for students in writing reports, since finding sources is a time-consuming part. About the life part, users can write in the note section for E.T to remind them to take medicines, an appointment time, or deadlines. Plus, E.T will automatically wake the users up by its voice, which I think is more effective than an ordinary alarm. Along with that is reminding users about the weather today before going out. E.T works best for those who live alone in consolidating their activities with the purpose to increase their lives quality.   </p>
                  <h1 class="ProjectIdeas2"> -Disabled and patient assistant:</h1>
                  <p class="PI">   Since the disabled find it hard in adapting to this society, E.T will support them in living. E.T will collect data from google maps in order to navigate the location of the users as well as the house; Therefore, the blind can go out easily, E.T will speak to them to support them throughout the way. Especially, the application is programmed to be supportive and secure so it can detect dangers. Particularly, when the users scream or the phone is hit hard on the ground, E.T automatically calls the most active person in the list of contacts, or SOS depends on the settings. </p>

                  <p class="PI">   The appearance of the AI will be a 2bit pixel cute face, which looks like alien floating devices’ screen. It can be edited depends on each one interests. Plus, the users can give E.T names, ages; Therefore, they can feel E.T as a human and feel more comfortable when asking for supports, instead of calling it “E.T”.      </p>
